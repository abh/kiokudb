=head1 NAME

KiokuDB::Entry - An entry in the database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object provides the meta data for a single storage entry.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item id

The UUID for the netry

=item root

Whether or not this is a member of the root set (not subject to garbage
collection, because storage was explicitly requested).

=item data

A simplified data structure modeling this object/reference. This is a tree, not
a graph, and has no shared data (JSON compliant). All references are symbolic,
using a L<KiokuDB::Reference> object with UIDs as the
address space.

=item class

If the entry is an object this contains the metaclass of that object.

=item prev

Contains a link to a L<KiokuDB::Entry> objects that precedes this one.

The last entry that was loaded from the store, or successfully written to the
store for a given UUID is kept in the live object set.

The collapser creates transient Entry objects, which if written to the store
successfully are replace the previous one.

=item live_objects

Used by transient entries to promote themselves using the
C<update_live_objects> method.

=item backend_data

Backends can use this to store additional meta data as they see fit.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item update_live_objects

If C<live_objects> is set, invoking this method will set this entry as the
current entry for an ID.

This should be called by the backend after an entry is successfully written.

=back

=head1 TODO

=over 4

=item *

Model tiedness as a specialization of class?
