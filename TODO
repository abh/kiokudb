* LiveObjects::Cached, using Tie::Cache::LRU (directly as an object, not via
  the tie interface)

* replace Data::Visitor with a dumb variant for entry visiting (ref
  simplification & JSPON expansion/collapsing), since they are never
  circular/weak/whatever


* Generic entry caching in the backends, possibly using LiveObjects?
