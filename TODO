* Backend roles:
    * Map ( for all UUID <-> serialized blob mappings )
    * Backend::CAS (content addressible map based on serialize)
    * Backend::Store
        * BDB
        * Dir
            * Flat
            * Trie
    * DBI
        * props + blob column with Serialize role
    * SQLite
        * with dynamic alter table statements?
        * audrey style indexing?
    * Backend::TXN
    * Backend::Locking
        * TXN::Exclusive

* lazy loadeding:
    * Set::Object
        * insert without loading members
        * remove without loading members
        * exists without loading members (object already loaded)
        * set operations produce ID sets
    * array
        * tie and lazy fetch
    * thunk
        * what are the degenerate cases?
        * how to break circular dependencies?
